              - kata = small coding problem, which you solve with TDD
              - comes from martial arts - sequence of movements that you do over and over
              - you mostly know how to solve it

            <h2>What I learnt from katas</h2>
            <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
              - goal: performance or screen recording with time restriction
              - practising over and over
              - improve my vim skills (finding shortcuts, typing)
              - TDD thinking become ingrained
              - certain refactorings went into my muscle memory (e.g. if/else to while to for)
              - live coding - nerve wracking - good to practise it

            - several code challenges to complete, like for example writing an HTTP server in Java
